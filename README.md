> "You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today." -Abraham Lincoln
```
GCP Deployment/Hosting/Endpoints
Kubeflow to manage distributed env 
Dockerize & GCP container registry
Data source: Equifax Data and Hacked Data
```
### Flask app QA, front-end and container: [Sarah]
```
-1st page that accepts user input and POSTs info to SQLite database 
-2nd page that GETs output of ML and provides recommendations (min 2) to user
-Unit testing of code with [Ponicode](https://www.ponicode.com) AI tool and [standards](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/testing/) 
-Containerization and registry
```

### Backend DBs trigger events to synchronize workflow events [Modsquad Team]
```
-1st user info
-2nd store look up table 
-store the output for continious training
```

### ML pipeline in storage bucket for recommendation engine [Mani]
```
-topic tracking lightweight NLP model & continuous training
```   

### Monitoring [Daisy]
```
GCP Metrics for VM instance
Google Analytics
Monitoring with WandB? Prometheus & Grafana? Code coverage? Data validation? API calls? Logging? 
Continious experimenting - how to guard against data drift?
```

### Final Presentation: [Modsquad Team/Sarah]
```
Plug into PPT a mapping of [MLOps Stack Template](https://ml-ops.org/content/state-of-mlops) to our Credit Invincible Capstone Project
```
### Undecided Issues:
```
Plug in components from [Linux Foundation AI Landscape](https://landscape.lfai.foundation)
MLflow for model versioning? 
Schedule & event triggers for overall project and specific ML pipeline?
```
